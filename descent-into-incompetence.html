            <p>I am fairly heavily involved with recruitment where I work, being the
author of the technical test and phone screen questions we use for
evaluating candidates, and conducting face-to-face interviews with many
of the hopefuls that get over these early hurdles.</p>
<p>Naturally, in order to gain these responsibilities I have gone through a
number of required HR ass-covering exercises in which it was drilled
into me that I am legally forbidden from asking questions about
sexuality, marital status, family-planning, and anything else which
might lead me into rejecting a candidate on grounds our beloved
government considers discriminatory.</p>
<p>Never mind that I have never shown the least inclination to discriminate
against someone because they might want to possibly think about maybe
taking some [mp]aternity leave in the next 30 years, or (gasp) prefer
the company of their own gender, or whatever; I have to go through all
this training so that the company can throw me to the wolves if a
candidate claims to have been discriminated against. "Not our fault,
guvnor; we explained the rules".</p>
<p>Still, fair enough I suppose; we live in litigious times, and not being
a bigot I have no particular fears of transgressing.</p>
<p>But what if the rules are changed? And what if they're changed in
horribly unexpected ways? A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7187032.stm">recent article</a> on the BBC
News site contained, quite without fanfare, some shocking intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previously standard questions about age, length of experience and
religious views are now illegal, Which? points out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what? Length of experience is now a forbidden topic? So if I'm
recruiting a senior developer or team lead, I now have to waste valuable
time interviewing fresh-out-of-college tyros who haven't written a
single line of commercial code or spent a single day working in a
professional team?</p>
<p>I can kind of see what is trying to be achieved here, but it is an
unavoidable fact that experience is a <em>vital</em> attribute for many senior
roles, and needs to be taken into consideration when trying to fill
those roles. It's not just me either - a quick trawl through the endless
agency emails I seem to get every day (despite telling them I'm not on
the market) reveals that most tech jobs are still specifying <em>n</em> years
of experience; this seems somewhat pointless now that candidates can't
be asked about it. I wonder if they know?</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the fact that many contract positions are still
paid at 'rates negotiable on experience'. Hah, how does that work when
experience is a forbidden subject? If I were graduating from university
this year I'd be whoring myself around the City applying for
£500-per-day contracting gigs and suing any bank that dared ask me to
justify my rate.</p>
<p>Rob Grant's novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Incompetence-Gollancz-Rob-Grant/dp/0575074493/">Incompetence</a></em> just became slightly less hysterical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Article 13199 of the Pan-European Constitution: "No person shall be
prejudiced from employment in any capacity, at any level, by reason of
age, race, creed or incompitence (<em>sic</em>).</p>
