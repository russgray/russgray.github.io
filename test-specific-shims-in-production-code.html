            <p>We're currently on a fairly major kick to increase automated test coverage of
our software. This doesn't just mean 'get the unit test coverage up to
scratch', it also means we are working towards full end-to-end integration
testing using, amongst other tools, some front-end automation tools such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTest_Professional">QTP</a> and <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is ever easy when trying to polish away the tarnish
of ancient code. One particular problem we face regularly is patching up
code that breaks the fragile expectations of some of these automation
tools.</p>
<p>Some of our applications - including the one <a href="./pg-wodehouse-method-of-refactoring.html">I am working to refactor</a> -
contain UI widgets that use a lot of custom painting routines and conceal data
pretty well. One widget, for instance, needs to display data with a fast
refresh rate and so uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_buffering#Double_Buffering_in_Computer_Graphics">double-buffered</a> approach to avoid flicker. The
data it displays, however, is not stored anywhere; it is discarded as soon as
it is rendered. And since the whole widget view is rendered as a bitmap and
blitted to screen, there's no convenient hierarchy of panels, labels, text
boxes, or any other standard controls.</p>
<p>This, the Automated QA folks tell me, causes a problem since QTP mainly works
by reflecting on properties exposed by controls to get at their data. So, if
QTP wants to read some data from a text box, it accesses the Text property of
that text box. Simple. But this particular widget doesn't have the equivalent
of a Text property.</p>
<p>This isn't really an oversight from a purely functional point of view, since
no part of the actual application code ever needs to get data from the widget
- it's a display mechanism only, not an interactive widget like a text box.
Data is received from a web service, processed a bit, and dumped into the
widget. The widget is the last object to do anything with the data - no other
part of the app ever needs it again.</p>
<p>Since there are no properties on the widget exposing the data, QTP can't get
at it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are ways to keep QTP happy. We can add a few properties to
the widget and keep some data around in member variables, or we can write some
extensions for QTP that allow it to access some of the widget's internals. The
second way is probably the 'right' way since it keeps test-related code
external to the application code - but it's more time-consuming, and also has
a training cost since most developers aren't going to be familiar with QTP's
API.</p>
<p>This leaves the first option. Traditionally I've always been a bit wary of
having what is effectively test code (since it only exists for testing
purposes) deployed with production code. Furthermore, doesn't it undermine the
tests themselves, since they are dependent on code that never gets executed in
production?</p>
<p>On the other hand, in some instances it may be the more pragmatic thing to do.
It's difficult to justify spending a day or two writing a few hundred lines of
QTP extension code when the same effect can be garnered by adding a single
read-only property. It still doesn't quite sit right for me though, and I
can't find much in the way of authoritative literature that argues one way or
the other.</p>
