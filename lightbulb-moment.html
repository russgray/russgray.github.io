            <p>Weiqi Gao has a post up today discussing the trials of grokking
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. Scala is a language I want to take a much closer look at later
this year, since I want to become current on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine">JVM</a> again (having not
been on talking terms with it since using J2SE 1.4 around the summer of 2003)
without being particularly keen on tangling with the Java language itself.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Scala is the functional programming style it
brings to the JVM. It's actually quite common to use certain functional
idioms in Java - e.g. passing around a function as a parameter - but the
syntax is clunky and verbose (unless and until closures get confirmed in
1.7, that is, and maybe even then).</p>
<p>For example, take a look at this very simple idiomatic code for spinning
off a thread to perform an expensive operation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Thread</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Runnable</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">run</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">someObj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doExpensiveOperation</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}).</span><span class="na">start</span><span class="o">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that's not the most hideous code I've ever seen, but it's a
bit...wordy. Compare it to this equivalent implementation in Java's
closest mainstream relative, C#:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Thread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">someObj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">DoExpensiveOperation</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">Start</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I much prefer this syntax, even taking into account the throwaway lambda
parameter that's only there to satisfy the ThreadStart signature. The
Scala syntax is even nicer, however:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">spawn</span><span class="o">({</span> <span class="n">someObj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">doSomethingExpensive</span> <span class="o">})</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is the sort of thing that piques my interest about the language -
expressive syntax and a very funky concurrency model will get my
attention, <em>especially</em> when running on something as mainstream as the
JVM and with full interoperability with the frankly staggeringly-vast
Java library ecosystem. I like F# on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a> for similar
reasons.</p>
<p>But I digress; what I wanted to talk about was a point made by Weiqi,
when discussing the pattern-matching capabilities of Scala:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pattern matching in Scala is exactly the point at which I would spend
time trying to understand it, trying to master it, trying to learn to
use it. I understand the syntax. I understand the explanation that the
speakers in presentations gave. I do get to the part where I say "This
is cool." But I never get to the point where I would see a problem and
say "This problem is best solved with pattern matching, let me fire up
Scala and code the solution."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strikes a chord for me, as I have gone through that stage once or
twice myself with other features in other languages and yet can't quite
put my finger on how I get past it. I don't think it's something you
consciously do - it's just something you keep grafting away at until
suddenly you realise that the technique, whatever it is, has become part
of your armoury.</p>
<p>Closures are an obvious example I can think of in my own background. I
was raised as a straight-down-the-middle C++ man, way back in the
early/mid-90s, cutting my teeth on Borland Turbo C++ 3 on Windows 3.1.
When I first started to play with functional languages it took a long
time for me to 'get it', and even when I understood what a closure was
after a couple of weekends hacking around in OCaml, I couldn't envisage
when I'd ever need one.</p>
<p>Soon after, whilst working on a Konfabulator widget in javascript, I
noticed I was using them all the time. I suddenly had much more insight
into what ruby blocks were doing. It wasn't so much that I noticed the
lights go on - <em>they'd been on for some time</em> and I hadn't realised.</p>
<p>People commonly refer to the 'lightbulb moment' or 'the lights went on'
as being the point where a flash of inspiration hits and everything
suddenly makes sense. I don't like this metaphor. If I need to go to the
bathroom in the middle of the night, when the lights go on I squint in
pain and stagger around just as blindly as I did before. But then I
acclimatise, and all becomes clear. And so it is, I think, with learning
alien concepts - you need a bit of time to adjust to the dazzling light.</p>
